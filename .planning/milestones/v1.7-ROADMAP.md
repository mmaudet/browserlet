**Phases:** 27-31 (5 phases)
**Requirements:** 21 total (CRED-09 to CRED-11, LLMB-01 to LLMB-05, BTST-01 to BTST-06, REPR-01 to REPR-05, REPT-01 to REPT-02)
**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-15
**Started:** 2026-02-14
**Shipped:** 2026-02-15

## Phases

### Phase 27: Credential Wiring

**Goal:** CLI runner substitutes credentials in BSL scripts using encrypted vault with master password protection

**Depends on:** Nothing (closes v1.6 tech debt)

**Requirements:** CRED-09, CRED-10, CRED-11

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. User can run CLI scripts containing {{credential:alias}} syntax with --vault flag
2. User is prompted once per session for master password to unlock vault
3. Credentials are substituted into scripts before execution with zero plaintext in logs

**Plans:** TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 27-01: TBD

### Phase 28: LLM Micro-Prompt Bridge

**Goal:** Cascade resolver stages 3-5 work in CLI via LLM call bridge from page context to Node.js

**Depends on:** Nothing (independent capability)

**Requirements:** LLMB-01, LLMB-02, LLMB-03, LLMB-04, LLMB-05

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. User can enable micro-prompts in CLI with --micro-prompts flag
2. Cascade resolver stages 3-5 successfully call LLM from page context via exposed bridge function
3. LLM provider abstraction supports Claude API, Ollama, and OpenAI Compatible endpoints
4. DOM context extraction around failure points respects token budgets
5. Structured LLM responses are validated before use to prevent malformed output errors

**Plans:** TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 28-01: TBD

---

### Phase 29: Batch Test Runner

**Goal:** Users can run entire directories of BSL test scripts with aggregated reporting

**Depends on:** Phase 27 (credential wiring for scripts with credentials)

**Requirements:** BTST-01, BTST-02, BTST-03, BTST-04, BTST-05, BTST-06

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. User can run all .bsl files in a directory with browserlet test command
2. Exit code aggregates results (0=all pass, 1=any fail, 2=any error)
3. Tests continue on failure by default, --bail flag stops on first failure
4. Each script runs in fresh browser context for isolation
5. Terminal displays batch summary with pass/fail/total counts and duration
6. Progress indicator shows current script and overall completion percentage

**Plans:** TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 29-01: TBD

---

### Phase 30: AI Auto-Repair

**Goal:** Failed steps can automatically retry with LLM-regenerated hints when --repair flag enabled

**Depends on:** Phase 28 (LLM bridge for hint regeneration)

**Requirements:** REPR-01, REPR-02, REPR-03, REPR-04, REPR-05

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. User can enable auto-repair with --repair flag (opt-in, default disabled)
2. Circuit breaker limits repair to max 3 retries per step and aborts script after 3 consecutive failures
3. SELECTOR_NOT_FOUND errors trigger repair attempts, TIMEOUT/NETWORK errors abort immediately
4. Repair attempts are logged with before/after context showing what changed
5. Token cost is tracked and displayed in summary report

**Plans:** TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 30-01: TBD

---

### Phase 31: HTML Report

**Goal:** Batch test runs produce visual HTML reports with step-by-step timeline and embedded screenshots

**Depends on:** Phase 29 (batch runner to aggregate results)

**Requirements:** REPT-01, REPT-02

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
1. HTML report shows step-by-step timeline with duration and status for each script
2. Report is generated to --output-dir after batch execution completes
3. Failure screenshots are embedded inline at the relevant step

**Plans:** TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 31-01: TBD

## Progress

| Phase | Requirements | Plans | Status | Completed |
|-------|--------------|-------|--------|-----------|
| 27. Credential Wiring | 3 | 1/1 | Complete | 2026-02-14 |
| 28. LLM Micro-Prompt Bridge | 5 | 3/3 | Complete | 2026-02-14 |
| 29. Batch Test Runner | 6 | 2/2 | Complete | 2026-02-15 |
| 30. AI Auto-Repair | 5 | 2/2 | Complete | 2026-02-15 |
| 31. Documentation & Examples | 2 | 1/1 | Complete | 2026-02-15 |

**Total:** 5 phases, 21 requirements, 9 plans — ALL COMPLETE

## Dependency Chain

```
Phase 27 (Credential Wiring) ────┐
                                 │
Phase 28 (LLM Bridge) ───────────┼──> Phase 30 (AI Auto-Repair)
                                 │
                                 ├──> Phase 29 (Batch Runner) ──> Phase 31 (HTML Report)
```

**Critical path:**
- Phase 27 can start immediately (no dependencies)
- Phase 28 can run parallel with Phase 27
- Phase 29 requires Phase 27 complete (credential wiring)
- Phase 30 requires Phase 28 complete (LLM bridge)
- Phase 31 requires Phase 29 complete (batch runner)

**Recommended execution order:** 27 → 28 → 29 → 30 → 31
